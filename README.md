# HandsFread: Hands Free Page Scrolling Bookmarklet

Want to read hands free?  Perhaps you have anew born that you need to bottlefeed and can't manage the scrolling and the feeding?  This will save you from the monotony of the late night bottle!

[Live Site](http://handsfread.herokuapp.com/)

Written using [Play 2](http://playframework.org), though that is largley irrelevant as it is mostly static HTML and some JavaScript.  Currently doesn't play well with many mobile browsers - I'm on it though.

# CHANGELOG

- **11/04/2012**: First release.  Mostly desktop only for now, some iOS issues with scrolling etc.
